Team Members and What We Did
- Christian Owusu-achiaw: Student Registration Page
- Riyah Miah: Home Screen and Session Enrollment Pages
- Alex Doan: Course Search Page
- Evan Arnold: Instructor Schedule Page, Session Enrollment Page, Overall Consistency


What Each Page Does
- Home: A main page directing a user to core functionalities
- Course Search: Lets you search by department, instructor, or course number, and shows info like credits, prerequisites, modality, and max enrollment
- Student Registration: Allows students to see what they’re enrolled in, and register for new sessions (with checks so they can’t register twice or go over capacity)
- Instructor Schedule: Allows instructors to see a table of the sessions they’re scheduled to be teaching
- Session Enrollment: Displays a list of students in a session (only accessible to the right users)

What We Used (HTML, CSS, JS)
- HTML for the page layout and structure (forms, tables, buttons, etc.)
- CSS to keep the colors, fonts, and styling consistent
- JavaScript to handle the basic logic for implementing basic functionality (sample data, login, enrollment validation)

Design Notes
- We tried to keep the look and navigation the same across all pages so it feels consistent
- Validation is not truly being done since this is just a UI/UX prototype
- We used sample data where applicable instead of connecting to a real database
